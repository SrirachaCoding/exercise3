Exercise 3

Description:
  A bit of practice with input via text files.

  Accepts a file name, reads the file, and offers to copy it. If you reply yes, it will make a filename_copy version.

Required software:
  * Git
  * python3

To Run:
  1* Open your console (Windows| CMD).
  2* Navigate to your desired projects folder (cd <path>)
  3* run the command 'git pull https://github.com/SrirachaCoding/exercise3.git'
      You should see it produce several lines confirming that it has downloaded the project
  4* run 'python from_file.py sample.txt'
      The program will begin running as intended. 
      
      If you wish to test it with other files, move it into the same folder (exercise3\) and replace "sample.txt" with the new filename.
  5* reply "yes" if you want a copy. The copy will appear in the same folder.
